# issue-tracker
REST API server + client for issues (similar to Github/Jira)

## Running the app

```bash
# backend
cd api
npm install 
npm start

# frontend
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Ideas

1. User authentication with JWT
2. User roles (admin, user)
3. Issues types (bug, feature, task)
4. Issues status (open, in progress, closed)
5. Integrate with database (e.g. MongoDB)
6. Buttons for filtering issue
7. Priorities for issues 
8. Due dates for issues
9. Search functionality
